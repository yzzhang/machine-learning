In addition, all of the columns (i.e., columns from _c22 to _c26 for Koalas dataframe, or columns from Unnamed: 22 to Unnamed: 26 for Pandas dataframe) have no data and thus can safely be dropped as well.\n",

In order to use machine learning to solve the problem, those categorical values must be transformed into numerical values because a machine learning model can only cosume numerical data. \n",

Too many features can lead to a [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) problem. To alleviate such problem, the values of these two columns are re-divided into a smaller number of buckets.\n",

    "Several data preprocessing steps share a common operation of transforming the values of a particular column in a Koalas dataframe. But, as described in [Koalas Series](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/api/databricks.koalas.Series.iloc.html#databricks.koalas.Series.iloc), the Koalas Series does not support some of the common Pandas indexing mechanisms such as df.iloc[0]. Because of this, there is no simple method of traversing and changling the values of a column in a Koalas dataframe. The other difficulty is that Koalas does not allow to build a new Koalas Series object from scratch and then add it as a new column in an existing Koalas dataframe. It only allows to use a new Koalas Series object that is built from the existing columns of a Koalas dataframe. These difficulties are avoided by defining a global function to call the apply() method of a Koalas Series object. "

This end-to-end development process follows the [Cross-industry standard process for data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining).
